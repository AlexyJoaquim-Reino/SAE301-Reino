                        <p>
                        The Multimedia and Internet program (BUT MMI) is a three-year curriculum situated in Champs sur Marne, in close proximity 
                        to Paris. With a strong emphasis on multidisciplinary proficiency, this program equips students with the necessary skills 
                        to excel in the dynamic field of multimedia. By seamlessly integrating theoretical knowledge with hands-on practical 
                        training, BUT MMI offers a holistic approach to learning, fostering expertise in programming, graphics, and communication.
                        Boasting a comprehensive duration of 2600 teaching hours, this program ensures an extensive educational experience. In the
                        second year, students have the opportunity to specialize in either digital creation or web development, further refining their 
                        expertise in their chosen field.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="sous_titre"> About the program briefly </h2>
                        <p>
                        The MMI program prepares individuals for diverse professional paths in the realm of web development, 
                        back-end development, UX design, web marketing, and audiovisual production. This comprehensive 
                        education equips students with a robust foundation of knowledge and skills, positioning them favorably
                        to embark upon their chosen career trajectories or pursue further studies at the master's level.
                        <p>
                            Within the MMI program, two distinct courses are offered: Web Development and Numeric Creation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The third year of the program is specifically dedicated to an alternating work-study arrangement. This 
                            allows students to engage in practical experience by working either one week per month at the university
                            and three weeks in a business setting, or one day per week at the university and four days per week in a business environment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, in the fourth semester, you have the option to specialize in either web development or digital creation, which offers a valuable and distinctive experience. Moreover, we send a few students to our partner institutions in Canada, providing them with an exciting opportunity to broaden their horizons and gain international exposure
